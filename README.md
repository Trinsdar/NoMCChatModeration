# No Minecraft Chat Moderation

Recently 1.19.1 introduced a new chat moderation feature to report mesages directly to minecraft, however there has been a huge upraor over it and all the potential avenues of abuse, which is where this comes in. This simply disables the sending of the report back to mojang, so therefore reporting people does nothing. This is a server side mod, so it is not required on the client.
